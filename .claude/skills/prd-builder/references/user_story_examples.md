```
As a [user type/persona],
I want to [perform action/use feature],
So that [achieve benefit/value].
```

### Alternative Formats

**Job Story (Jobs-to-be-Done):**
```
When [situation],
I want to [motivation],
So I can [expected outcome].
```

## Anatomy of Good User Stories

### INVEST Criteria

Good user stories are:

- **Independent:** Can be developed and delivered separately
- **Negotiable:** Details can be discussed and adjusted
- **Valuable:** Delivers clear value to users or business
- **Estimable:** Can be sized/estimated by the team
- **Small:** Can be completed in one iteration/sprint
- **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria

### Key Components

1. **User Type:** Who is the user? Be specific.
2. **Action:** What do they want to do? One clear action.
3. **Value:** Why do they want it? The benefit or outcome.
4. **Acceptance Criteria:** How do we know it's done? Testable conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria Patterns

### Given-When-Then Format

Most structured format, excellent for complex logic:

```
Given [initial context/state],
When [action/event],
Then [expected outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
Given I'm a logged-in user with items in my cart,
When I apply a 20% discount code,
Then the cart total is reduced by 20% and displays the discount.
```

### Checklist Format

Simpler, good for straightforward requirements:

```
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Edge case handling
```

### Table Format

Great for multiple scenarios:

| Condition | Action | Expected Result |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Valid email | Click "Send" | Confirmation message |
| Invalid email | Click "Send" | Error message |
| Empty field | Click "Send" | "Required field" error |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Technical

**Bad:**
```
As a user,
I want the system to use Redis caching with 10-minute TTL,
So that page loads are fast.
```

**Good:**
```
As a user,
I want pages to load in under 2 seconds,
So that I can browse efficiently.
```

**Why:** User stories focus on user value, not implementation. Let engineers choose the solution.

---

### ❌ Too Vague

**Bad:**
```
As a user,
I want the app to be fast,
So that I have a good experience.
```

**Good:**
```
As a user,
I want search results to appear in under 1 second,
So that I can quickly find what I need.
```

**Why:** "Fast" is subjective. Be specific and measurable.

---

### ❌ Missing the "Why"

**Bad:**
```
As a user,
I want to upload profile pictures.
```

**Good:**
```
As a user,
I want to upload a profile picture,
So that other users can recognize me in the community.
```

**Why:** Understanding the "why" helps the team make better decisions.

---

### ❌ Multiple Actions in One Story

**Bad:**
```
As a user,
I want to create an account, set up my profile, and invite team members,
So that I can start using the platform.
```

**Good:** Split into three stories:
```
Story 1: As a user, I want to create an account...
Story 2: As a user, I want to set up my profile...
Story 3: As an account owner, I want to invite team members...
```

**Why:** Stories should be small and focused on one capability.

---

### ❌ No Acceptance Criteria

**Bad:**
```
As a user,
I want to search for products,
So that I can find what I need.
```

**Good:** Add specific criteria:
```
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Search works on product name and description
- [ ] Results display in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Displays "No results found" when no matches
- [ ] Shows top 20 results with pagination
```

**Why:** Acceptance criteria define "done" and enable testing.

## Story Splitting Techniques

When a story is too large, use these techniques to split it:

### 1. By Workflow Steps

**Large Story:**
```
As a user, I want to book a flight online.
```

**Split Stories:**
- Search for flights
- Select flight
- Enter passenger details
- Choose seat
- Make payment
- Receive confirmation

---

### 2. By User Persona

**Large Story:**
```
As a user, I want to manage my subscriptions.
```

**Split Stories:**
- As a free user, I want to view available plans
- As a paid user, I want to upgrade my plan
- As an admin, I want to manage team subscriptions

---

### 3. By Business Rules

**Large Story:**
```
As a user, I want to apply discount codes.
```

**Split Stories:**
- Apply percentage discount (e.g., 20% off)
- Apply fixed amount discount (e.g., $10 off)
- Apply free shipping discount
- Handle expired discount codes
- Limit one discount per order

---

### 4. By Data Variations

**Large Story:**
```
As a user, I want to import contacts.
```

**Split Stories:**
- Import from CSV file
- Import from Google Contacts
- Import from Microsoft Outlook
- Import from LinkedIn

---

### 5. By CRUD Operations

**Large Story:**
```
As a user, I want to manage my projects.
```

**Split Stories:**
- Create a new project
- View project details
- Update project settings
- Delete a project

---

### 6. By Happy Path / Edge Cases

**MVP Story (Happy Path):**
```
As a user, I want to upload a profile photo (JPG, < 5MB).
```

**Follow-up Stories:**
- Support additional formats (PNG, GIF)
- Handle files larger than 5MB with error message
- Auto-crop/resize images
- Allow photo deletion

---

## Story Sizing Guidelines

### Story Points Reference

**1-2 Points (Few hours):**
- Simple UI change
- Copy update
- Minor configuration

**3-5 Points (1-2 days):**
- New form with validation
- Simple API endpoint
- Basic feature toggle

**8 Points (3-5 days):**
- Complex form with business logic
- Integration with third-party service
- New database schema with migration

**13+ Points (1+ weeks):**
- Too large! Split the story
- Consider as an Epic

```

### Error Handling

```
As a user,
I want to see helpful error messages,
So that I know how to fix issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Error messages are specific (not generic "Error occurred")
- [ ] Suggest actionable next steps
- [ ] Display in user's language
- [ ] Don't expose technical details (stack traces)
- [ ] Log errors for debugging (backend)
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Write from user perspective**, not system perspective
2. **Focus on value/benefit**, not just functionality
3. **Keep stories small** (completable in one sprint)
4. **Make acceptance criteria testable**
5. **Use consistent format** across your team
6. **Include edge cases** in acceptance criteria
7. **Collaborate** with engineers and designers when writing
8. **Refine regularly** based on new learnings
9. **Link to mockups/designs** when relevant
10. **Prioritize ruthlessly** (must/should/nice-to-have)

## Additional Resources

### User Story Template

```
Title: [Concise feature name]

As a [specific user type],
I want to [action/capability],
So that [benefit/value].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Edge case handling]

Priority: [Must Have / Should Have / Nice to Have]
Story Points: [1/2/3/5/8/13]
Dependencies: [List if any]

Notes: [Additional context]
```

### Epic vs Story vs Task

**Epic:** Large body of work (multiple sprints)
- Example: "User Authentication System"

**Story:** Deliverable value (one sprint)
- Example: "As a user, I want to reset my password..."

**Task:** Implementation step (hours/days)
- Example: "Create password reset API endpoint"

---

## Conclusion

Effective user stories:
- Start with the user's perspective
- Clearly articulate value
- Include testable acceptance criteria
- Are sized appropriately
- Enable team collaboration

Use these examples as templates, but adapt them to your product and users' specific needs!
